# Employee_Management_System---Desktop_Application

The API Abstract Window Toolkit (or awt) and Swing Framework were used while creating the desktop application. The in-built java classes JPane, JTextField, JTable, JComboBox, JLabel, JOptionPane, JButton, and JPasswordField have been used to create the pages whereas the in-built java classes sql.Connection, sql.PreparedStatement, sql.ResultSet, sql.DriverManager, awt.event.ActionListener, awt.event.ActionEvent, and anonymous classes Runnable, and ActionListener have been used to add extra features to the application.
